Adding an SFZ file is pretty simple.

A normal SF2 file contains PRESETS, which are subdivided in two different "branches":

BANK, which are used by the MIDI driver for (example) XG and GM soundsets (Default is 0, GM)
PRESET, which are used to select the instrument itself (Piano, Carillon etc...)

Normal presets for a piano are:

EX. BANK - PRESET (NAME)

0 - 0 (Acoustic Grand Piano)
0 - 1 (Bright Grand Piano)
0 - 2 (Electric Grand Piano)
0 - 3 (Honky-Tonk Piano)
0 - 4 (Electric Piano 1)
0 - 5 (Electric Piano 2)
etc...

8 - 0 (Acoustic Grand Piano, XG)
8 - 1 (Bright Grand Piano, XG)
8 - 2 (Electric Grand Piano, XG)
8 - 3 (Honky-Tonk Piano, XG)
etc...

Banks from 126 to 128 are reserved for drumsets.
Opening a GM/GS soundfont (Like Arachno Soundfont) is a good way to organize SFZ files, by taking the original bank and preset numbers through Polyphone.
