While focused on a MIDI app that is using the driver, you will be able to do the following:

CTRL + 1: Reload soundfont list 1
CTRL + 2: Reload soundfont list 2
CTRL + 3: Reload soundfont list 3
CTRL + 4: Reload soundfont list 4
INSERT: Reset the MIDI synth, by dropping all the current notes.

(The speed of the soundfont preloading is mainly influenced by your hard disk/solid state drive.)
